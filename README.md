# Sailing Timer

### A sailing race start timer for the Garmin Connect IQ platform, following the ISAF 5-4-1-0 sequence

Every minute emits a beep and vibrates.

At the start emits an alarm, vibrates and then times up for the race duration.

The timer can be synchronised to the nearest minute, up or down.

Currently only supports the Fênix 3 as thats the device I own.
